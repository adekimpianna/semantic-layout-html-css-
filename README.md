This is a part of exercises done in class in the second module Incremental Development in HYF coding course. The objectives are :
* to get used to create branch and merge it to master
* to be able to make development strategy properly
* to start including HTML and CSS on assignments 

### Tools
* GitHub
* Gitkraken
* Visual Studio Code

### How
After making a new repo, clone it, open it on visual code studio, the branch can be made directly from Github, or via GitKraken (I did with this), or via Visual Code Directly.
(*My stages** to create branches (after open all files on GitKraken and VSC)
1. Create a branch via GitKraken (make sure you are on master file) and then name it. On Viscod it will be automatically changed to the new branch, check left bottom.
1. Make your changes
1. If you like them, commit!
1. Push to Github, then check on Github Network to make sure the branch is open and a commit is there
1. Then return to GitKraken, checkout master file then merge the branch to master by click right on your mouse, choose the action merge.
1. Push again to Github and check on Network to make sure your branch is merged.
1. Repeat!
